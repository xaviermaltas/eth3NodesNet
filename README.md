This project is an **Ethereum Network with 3 nodes running locally**.

>Requirments -> Linux (Tested on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS),GO and Geth

After cloning the repo I recomend to **clean the environment**. 
The following command will clear all that could be at the DB:
```
./reGenesisAll.sh
```

For **running** the 3 nodes network, execute the command bellow:
```
./start_network.sh
```

To **stop the network**, use :

```
./stop_network.sh
```
